I am requesting help to start a positive support and feedback chat or app to help guide and teach about intuition awareness.

I would like it to be set up in a private text only no phone calls. I want to be able to write creatively and respond to clients  like dear abbey. The only thing required is an email, photo, and brief letter of what is their situation. Only volunteers hired can offer advise and see all responses. Clients can only see their stuff and nobody elses so it's completely private without other people's negativity. Kinda like a psychic chat but no tarot or anything. It's completely non profit to help bring a positive light. Give some hope and encouragement.
